This is an interpreter for Minijava programs.

It's not complete, but I'm probably done working on it.

Here are some problems:
* There is no type-checking of any kind.
* Some (irrelevant) name resolution conflicts are ignored.
* Operator precedence is ignored.
* Multiline comments are not handled.
