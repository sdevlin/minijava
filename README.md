This is an interpreter for [MiniJava](http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/) programs.

It's not complete, but I'm probably done working on it.

Here are some problems:
* There is no type-checking of any kind.
* Some (irrelevant) name resolution conflicts are ignored.
* Operator precedence is ignored.
* Multiline comments are not handled.

That said, it runs all the provided test programs correctly. It also runs the program I wrote (test/fibonacci.java) correctly.
